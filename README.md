A quick website served by go and gorilla/mux so I can show off my resume and host some go stuff I've made.

I did this:
- partly to experiment a tiny bit with what I can do with gorilla/mux (logging, middleware, file serving), 
- partly to get better at frontend development (mainly bootstrap, but maybe I'll do something cool that needs javascript), 
- and partly to, you know, host the actual content!

Enjoy the weird little logo, too. I made it in GIMP and it was a delight.
